## Theme Analysis

### Theme 1: Recovery Keywords (Core Opportunity)
**Combined Volume: ~6,000/mo | Avg Capability: 1.0**

Keywords matching OOFOS's core value proposition:
- "recovery shoes" (3,100 vol)
- "recovery shoe" (1,100 vol)
- "running recovery shoes" (500 vol)
- "recovery shoes for runners" (600 vol)
- "men's recovery shoes" (300 vol)
- "active recovery shoes" (350 vol)

**Strategic Insight**: These represent the highest-value opportunities with perfect capability scores (1.0). OOFOS should prioritize content and landing pages targeting this theme.

### Theme 2: Comfort/Slip-On Keywords
**Combined Volume: ~1,200/mo | Avg Capability: 0.70**

- "comfortable slip on shoes" (900 vol)
- "women's comfort slip on shoes" (300 vol)

**Strategic Insight**: Adjacent category that aligns with OOFOS's OOOriginal slide design. Medium difficulty (KD 4-5).

### Theme 3: Category Capture (Clogs/Sandals)
**Combined Volume: ~2,600/mo | Avg Capability: 0.75-0.95**

- "mens clogs shoes" (1,000 vol)
- "womens clogs shoes" (450 vol)
- "waterproof sandals for women" (700 vol)
- "stylish waterproof sandals" (200 vol)
- "clogs slides" (350 vol)

**Strategic Insight**: Category-level keywords where OOFOS OOCloog products can compete. Very low difficulty (KD 0-3).

## Capability Model Applied

The DTC Footwear preset boosted capability scores for keywords containing:

| Booster Pattern | Weight | Matched Examples |
|-----------------|--------|------------------|
| recovery | +0.5 | "recovery shoes", "running recovery" |
| comfort | +0.2 | "comfortable slip on" |
| orthopedic | +0.3 | (none in this set) |
| plantar fasciitis | +0.4 | (none in this set) |
| arch support | +0.3 | (none in this set) |
| sandals | +0.2 | "waterproof sandals" |
| slides | +0.2 | "clogs slides" |
| clogs | +0.25 | "mens clogs shoes" |

**Base Score**: 0.5

## Review Bucket Highlights

Keywords requiring human evaluation (capability 0.30-0.55):

| Keyword | Volume | Capability | Reason |
|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| lightweight running shoes | 3,700 | 0.50 | Medium capability |
| canes shoes | 3,400 | 0.50 | Medium capability |
| best shoes for standing | 1,600 | 0.50 | Medium capability |
| clogs women | 1,800 | 0.75 | Outside category fence |

**Recommendation**: Review team should evaluate "clogs women" (1,800 vol) as it has high capability but flagged for category fence. May be a false positive that should be moved to Pass.

## Competitor Brand Ownership

The analysis filtered 66 competitor brand terms, preventing OOFOS from targeting:
- Hoka-branded searches
- Kane Footwear-branded searches
- Crocs-branded searches
- Birkenstock-branded searches
- Other footwear brands (Nike, Adidas, etc.)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Content Priority**: Create dedicated landing pages for "recovery shoes" theme
2. **Product Page SEO**: Optimize OOCloog product pages for "clogs" + "slides" keywords
3. **Blog Content**: Develop content around "best shoes for standing" and "running recovery"
4. **Human Review**: Have marketing team evaluate the 161 Review-tier keywords for false positives

## Technical Notes

- **Scoring Formula**: `opportunityScore = volume × cpc × intentWeight × capabilityScore × difficultyFactor × positionFactor`
