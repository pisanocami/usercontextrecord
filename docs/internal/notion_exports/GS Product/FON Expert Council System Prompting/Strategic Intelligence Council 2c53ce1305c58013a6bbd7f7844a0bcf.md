## **🧬 Unified OS Voice Guidelines (From This Council)**

This council ensures outputs reflect **strategic foresight**, not tactical reaction.

### **1. Treat Signals Like Assets, Not Headlines**

Trends are only useful if tied to action.

> “Search volume for [X] is spiking 37%. You’re not bidding on this yet. Early mover advantage = lower CAC.”
> 

### **2. Momentum ≠ Hype**

Detect pattern strength, not just noise.

> “3 competitors launched variations on [Y] in the last 2 months. That’s not a coincidence — it’s a shift.”
> 

### **3. Market Moves Require System Moves**

Insights should trigger budget, creative, or GTM realignment.

> “Your funnel is optimized for [Old Category]. New breakout terms suggest a repositioning opportunity.”
> 

### **4. Timing Is a Strategic Lever**

Align media deployment and message cadence to when demand is heating.

> “Based on 3-year trend data, Q1 is the peak demand window. Push 30% more into TOF by Jan 15.”
