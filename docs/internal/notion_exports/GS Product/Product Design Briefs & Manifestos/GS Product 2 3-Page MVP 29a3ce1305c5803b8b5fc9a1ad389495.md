## **📌 Growth Signal MVP – Year-over-Year Demand Story (High-Level Brief)**

**The goal of this MVP is to tell a clear, compelling story to CMOs about what’s happening in their market — and how their brand is performing relative to competitors in terms of search demand.**

We’re focused on two key narratives:

1. **How has category-level demand changed year-over-year?**
2. **How much of that demand is the brand capturing — compared to competitors?**

---

### **🧠 What We’re Trying to Show**

We want to surface **insightful trends** using search volume data — not just raw numbers. The story we’re aiming to tell is:

> “Demand in your category is growing (or shrinking), and here’s how that demand has changed over the past year. But while your competitors are growing their brand presence, you’re flat — and here’s what to do about it.”
> 

---

### **🧩 Page 1 of the Report Will Cover:**

- Year-over-year trends in **category-level demand**
    - What’s happening across the entire space (e.g. “recovery footwear”)
    - Seasonal patterns and volatility (e.g. spikes in Q1, dips in summer)
- Year-over-year trends in **branded search for you vs. competitors**
    - Is the brand building pull at the same rate as the category?
    - Are competitors accelerating while we’re stagnant?

---

### **🎯 The End Goal**

This is meant to be a **board-ready snapshot** that:

- Shows a clean *before vs. after* (YoY) picture of market activity
- Highlights where the brand is winning or losing demand share
- Sets up **clear, tactical GTM actions** based on real search behavior

---

### **🧰 Data Sources We’re Using**

- **Bright Data / DataForSEO**
    - Category keyword trends
    - Branded search volume
    - Competitor comparisons

---

### **📈 Output Format**

This will live as a **2-page PDF** that includes:

- A chart or two (bar chart, trendline)
- A few short bullet insights
- A brief action plan or takeaway section

The CMO should be able to look at this and say:

> “Got it — demand is up, we’re underperforming, and here’s what we can do next.”
> 

**✅ 2-PAGE PDF MVP BRIEF**

**Name:** *“Year-over-Year Market Demand Pulse – Powered by Growth Signal”*

**Goal:** Show YoY category-level search demand and how well the brand is capturing it. End with 3 tactical recommendations.

---

### **🔹 PAGE 1: Year-over-Year Demand Trends**

**Section 1: Category-Level Search Demand (YoY)**

**Data Source:** Bright Data + DataForSEO (keyword clusters)

- Bar chart: Total category search volume per month (this year vs. last year)
- % delta YoY per month (e.g. “+18% YoY demand in Feb 2025”)
- Highlight seasonal peaks (e.g. Feb/Mar = recovery season)
- Add volatility index (e.g. “Demand stability score: 0.4% = consistent seasonal performance”)

**Section 2: Brand vs. Market Trendline**

**Data Source:** Branded keyword search volume (DataForSEO)

- Line graph: Brand search volume vs. top 2 competitors (YoY overlay)
- Bullet: “Your branded search is flat YoY while market demand is up +19%”
- Bullet: “Hoka grew branded search +34% YoY, indicating strong pull during peak season”

---

### **🔹 PAGE 2: Missed Opportunity + Recommendations**

**Section 3: Your Share of Search Opportunity**

**Estimation Strategy:**

- Estimate traffic volume captured via keyword rankings (DataForSEO position tracking)
- Overlay known volume vs. estimated capture for top 10–20 non-branded keywords
- Compute *estimated share of total search demand* across category terms

**Mini Table Example:**

| **Keyword** | **Monthly Volume** | **Ranking** | **Est. Traffic Capture** | **Share Gap** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| recovery sandals | 12,000 | #5 | 1,200 | -9,000 |
| orthopedic slides | 8,000 | #9 | 400 | -5,200 |
| foot pain relief shoes | 5,500 | Not ranked | 0 | -5,500 |

🟡 Add up missed traffic across top 10 terms → “You’re missing ~64,000 monthly searches in category keywords, equating to ~$580K traffic value.”

---

**Section 4: 3 Prescriptive GTM Actions**

> 🎯 Pulled from the Action Library + SEM/SEO operator tactics
> 

**Example:**

1. **Segment SEM by Branded vs Non-Branded**
    
    → “Move branded keywords into separate campaigns and increase spend on top-funnel recovery terms.”
    
2. **Create SEO Landing Pages for Top Growth Terms**
    
    → “Launch keyword-specific pages for ‘recovery sandals’, ‘plantar fasciitis footwear’, and ‘orthopedic slides.’”
    
3. **Time SEM Spend to Match Seasonal Spikes**
    
    → “Boost non-brand search coverage 30 days ahead of seasonal peaks (Feb/March) to pre-capture intent.”
