# GS | Product | MVP Landing Page Launch

## ✨ OVERVIEW

**Product:** Growth Signal System

**Business Use:** AI-native GTM engine to power Force of Nature’s agency growth, unlock enterprise leads, and build scalable outbound.

We are NOT building a SaaS platform (yet). We are building an **internal intelligence engine** that:

- Identifies high-signal prospects
- Generates custom Growth Signal pages per brand
- Powers outbound and inbound acquisition
- Feeds the funnel for Growth Pulse, Analysis, and OS installs

---

## 🔢 CORE STRATEGY

### ✅ Step 1: Use Growth Signal to Drive Awareness

- Pull external data for 1,000–5,000 brands
- Output custom Growth Signal reports (static or lightly interactive)
- Generate statically hosted landing pages: `/growth-signal/{brand}`
- Show partial report (30%); lock remainder behind form or payment

### ✅ Step 2: Activate via Outbound + Retargeting

- Send highly personalized cold emails (e.g. “Search interest is up 43%—you’re underinvested in SEM.”)
- Launch retargeting flows (Meta, LinkedIn, GDN)
- Trigger email drips / outreach from engagement

### ✅ Step 3: Convert via Pulse & OS Install

- Upsell Growth Pulse (Quick Look, $1.5K) after engagement
- Then sell full Growth Analysis ($25K) and OS install ($50–$150K/month)

## ✍️ NOTES FOR DESIGNERS & BUILDERS

- Output should feel like Stripe x Superhuman x Mailchimp — sleek but playful
- Visual metaphors: Fibonacci spirals, signal waves, data growth loops
- CTA rhythm: Learn → Preview → Unlock → Call
- Motion: Light animations OK (signal pulsing, page layering), but keep page light

- Add: Lead scoring & routing (Clearbit + CRM integration)
- Add: Generative layer for vertical-specific landing pages (e.g. /beauty /homegoods)
