## **🧱 Product Principles to Follow**

## 

| **Principle** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Data is Primary** | Every insight must point to a real, labeled source (Google Trends, DataForSEO, Bright Data) |
| **Modules over Narratives** | Each section is a reusable unit, not a hand-crafted story |
| **Vertical Templates Drive Scale** | Default keyword/query packs should be based on vertical (e.g. Footwear, Skincare, Wellness) |
| **Insights = Actionables** | Every module should deliver a “So what?” tied to growth or spend allocation |
|  |  |

## **🛠️ Immediate Deliverables for Product**

1. **Refactor current OOFOS brief** into new Growth Signal architecture
2. **Build v1 reusable modules**:
    - Search Demand Chart
    - Brand Search Share
    - SEO Gap Table
    - Retail Visibility Grid
    - Pricing Snapshot
    - Brand/Non-Brand Capture %
3. **Apply to 2 other verticals**: Skincare, Supplements
4. **Template out query packs** by category for scalable ingestion

# **📣 GROWTH SIGNAL – POSITIONING MEMO**

**Purpose**: Guide how we evolve the current version into a more **data-led, scalable product experience** — where **AI supports the data**, not replaces it.

---

## **🧭 The Shift We’re Making**

We’re evolving our current external Growth Signal reports from:

> “Strategic insight powered by AI”
> 

> ➡️ to
> 

> “Structured data + systemized insight, with AI helping us synthesize”
> 

The core idea we want to embed in the tone, formatting, and logic of the report is:

> “We don’t just surface data — we identify what matters, interpret the implications, and translate it into strategic direction.
> 

> This is what we can do from the outside: using only public and semi-public data, we’ve been able to uncover real opportunities, gaps, and optimizations.
> 

> Now imagine what we could do if we could see inside — if we had access to your actual performance data, media spend, retention curves, and SKU margins.
> 

> We’d take the same system — and make it exponentially more powerful.”
>

## **🔁 What Needs to Shift (High-Level)**

### **✅ 1. Lead With Data, Not Strategy**

**Before**: Start with a phase or narrative

**Now**: Start with a dataset — let the insight emerge from it

→ Show the **chart first**, then the interpretation, then the insight

---

### **✅ 2.Use Modular, Reusable Blocks**

Each insight should be:

- Self-contained
- Source-labeled
- Plug-and-play across brands
    
    → This turns the report into a **template system**, not a custom slide deck
    

---

### **✅ 3.**

### **Make the AI Invisible**

We still use Gemini for synthesis, but:

- No generative “voice” unless it’s summarizing a dataset
- Use natural, data-backed business language — not clever AI prose *define FON voice as needed. Let me know what you have.
    
    → Readers should think: **“They have signal”**, not **“They used a chatbot”**
    

---

### **✅ 4.**

### **Embed the Unlock CTA Everywhere**

Every section should implicitly or explicitly set up the moment:

> “With your internal data (GA4, CRM, Meta, Shopify), we could go even deeper here.”
> 

Examples:

- “With access to your real CACs, we could tell you how much cheaper this channel could be.”
- “This is what we know from Bright Data — with SKU-level margin, we’d optimize profitability too.”

---

## **🧱 Structural Guidance**

Stick to a modular format like:

1. **Insight Title**
2. **What we’re seeing** (quant, chart-backed)
3. **Where it comes from** (source stamp)
4. **Why it matters**
5. **What we could do with access** (Growth Pulse CTA)

**✨ Positioning Pillars**

| **Principle** | **What It Looks Like** |
| --- | --- |
| **Data First** | Every idea flows from a chart, table, or scrape |
| **Systemized Language** | No brand-specific metaphors, no “cute” copy |
| **Source-Labeled** | Google Trends, DataForSEO, Bright Data — always shown |
| **Modular** | Every insight = standalone block (not story arc) |
| **Scalable** | Designed to work for any DTC brand (not just OOFOS) |
|  |  |

## **🛑 Avoid**

- ❌ Overuse of AI-generated phrases (“Your north star is…”)
- ❌ Strategic “phase” language without clear data underneath
- ❌ Custom brand narrative that doesn’t translate to other brands
- ❌ Unlabeled charts or assumptions not tied to sources

---

## **✅ Embrace**

- ✅ A clear, repeatable insight format
- ✅ Data > voice
- ✅ Consistent positioning:
    
    > “This is what we found from the outside — imagine what’s inside.”
    >
