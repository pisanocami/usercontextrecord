## 🧠 Core Architecture Insight

The Growth Signal Master Report is organized into **three stacked intelligence layers**.

| Layer | Function | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Signal Layer** | External Reality | Market demand, search behavior, competitors, trends |
| **Pulse Layer** | System Health | Inferred execution signals and structural strengths/weaknesses |
| **Analysis Layer** | Decisions | Strategic interpretation, tradeoffs, and actions |

This structure mirrors how executive teams reason:

> Understand the world → assess position → decide what to do.
