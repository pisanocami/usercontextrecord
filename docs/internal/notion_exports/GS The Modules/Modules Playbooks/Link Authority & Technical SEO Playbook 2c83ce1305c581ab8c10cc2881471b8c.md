    **Version:** v1  
    **Inference Type:** External  
    **Confidence Level:** High

    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    This module evaluates whether the **site’s structural SEO foundation** is strong enough to compete for high-intent demand.
    
    It focuses on **authority, link health, and technical integrity**, not surface-level SEO scores.
    
    It answers:
    > **“Are we structurally capable of ranking — or is demand capture blocked?”**

    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Assess **SEO readiness** before investing in content or demand creation.
    
    **This module informs:**
    - Content investment decisions
    - SEO vs paid arbitration
    - Deprioritization of unwinnable keywords
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Replace a full technical audit
    - Prescribe detailed fixes
    - Evaluate content quality
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    ### Primary Data Source
    - **Ahrefs** — domain-level metrics
    
    ### Key Signals
    - Domain Rating (relative)
    - Referring domain velocity
    - Link decay rate
    - Indexation anomalies (high-level)
    
    Monthly refresh cadence.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Logic & Risk Flags
    
    Signals are interpreted **relative to competitors**, not in isolation.
    
    Flags raised when:
    - Authority gap exceeds threshold
    - Link decay outpaces acquisition
    - Technical anomalies align with ranking drops
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The SEO Council enforces:
    - Structure before content
    - Relative competitiveness over absolute scores
    
    Technical weakness is a **gating factor**, not an optimization task.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🚦 Confidence & Risk Profile
    
    - **Confidence Level:** High  
    - **Risk if Wrong:** Low  
    
    Why:
    - Structural signals are stable
    - Comparative analysis reduces noise
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - Authority comparison table
    - Structural readiness flag
    - SEO gating assessment
    
    Feeds directly into:
    - Keyword Gap & Visibility
    - Deprioritization Flags
    - Action Cards (if remediation needed)
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    ### What this means
    - Whether SEO investment is viable
    - Whether structure blocks growth
    
    ### What this does NOT mean
    - “Fix everything”
    - “Buy links”
    - “SEO will work immediately”
    
    ---
    
    ## ⛔ Stop Rules
    
    Do **not** overreact when:
    - Authority gaps are marginal
    - Short-term ranking volatility exists
    - Competitive domains are anomalous outliers
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“Can SEO work for us right now?”**
    
    Before asking:
    > “What should we build?”
    ```
