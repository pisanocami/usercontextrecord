    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    This module analyzes whether demand is being captured primarily through **brand recognition** or through **category-level discovery**.
    
    Its purpose is to reveal **over-reliance on branded demand**, which can inflate perceived efficiency and limit growth.
    
    It answers:
    > **“Are customers finding us because they want *us* — or because they need *this category*?”**

    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Diagnose demand mix health and growth ceiling risk.
    
    **This module informs:**
    - TOF investment decisions
    - SEO and content prioritization
    - Brand vs category acquisition balance
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Judge brand strength
    - Prescribe exact channel mix
    - Replace lifecycle analysis
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    ### Primary Data Source
    - **Ahrefs** — Search demand split
    
    ### Scope Rules
    - Branded terms normalized across variants
    - Category terms grouped by intent
    - Monthly refresh cadence
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Logic & Classification
    
    Demand is classified into:
    - **Branded Demand** — explicit brand queries
    - **Non-Branded Demand** — category and problem queries
    
    Key ratios:
    - Brand dependency %
    - Category exposure %
    
    Patterns are evaluated **over time**, not point-in-time.

    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The Performance Media Council enforces:
    - No false efficiency narratives
    - Awareness of dark social amplification
    
    The SEO Council enforces:
    - Intent-level interpretation
    - Structural SEO readiness
    
    High branded share is **not bad** — but it is **fragile**.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🚦 Confidence & Risk Profile
    
    - **Confidence Level:** Medium  
    - **Risk if Wrong:** Medium  
    
    Why:
    - Search behavior lags awareness
    - Brand search can be demand echo, not demand creation
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - Brand vs category demand split
    - Historical trend chart
    - Growth risk flags
    
    Feeds directly into:
    - Strategic Summary
    - Action Cards
    - Market Momentum interpretation
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    ### What this means
    - How discoverable the brand is
    - How scalable acquisition may be
    - Where TOF investment is needed
    
    ### What this does NOT mean
    - “Brand is weak”
    - “Paid should stop”
    - “SEO alone will fix this”
    
    ---
    
    ## ⛔ Stop Rules
    
    Do **not** act when:
    - Brand search growth is newly accelerating
    - Product launches are recent
    - Offline campaigns dominate awareness
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“How are people finding us today?”**
    
    Not:
    > “Is our brand good or bad?”
    ```
