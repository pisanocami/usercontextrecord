    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    The Strategic Summary is the **narrative spine** of the Growth Signal report.
    
    It synthesizes all upstream signal into a **clear, executive-level story** about:
    - What’s happening
    - Why it matters
    - Where attention should focus
    
    This is not a recap.  
    It is an **interpretive summary** designed for decision-makers.

    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Create shared understanding before decisions are made.
    
    This module:
    - Aligns stakeholders on reality
    - Frames urgency and opportunity
    - Sets context for Action Cards and OS Drop
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Recommend specific actions (Action Cards do)
    - Rank initiatives (Priority Scoring does)
    - Replace detailed analysis
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    **Upstream Inputs**
    - Market Context modules
    - Brand Positioning modules
    - Execution Signals
    - Confidence and risk flags from Ops & Attribution
    
    No new data is introduced.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Narrative Logic
    
    The Strategic Summary must answer **three questions, in order**:
    
    ### 1. What’s changing?
    Market, demand, competitive, or structural shifts.
    
    ### 2. Where do we stand?
    Visibility, positioning, efficiency, or risk relative to peers.
    
    ### 3. Why does this matter now?
    Timing, momentum, or compounding effects.
    
    If a sentence does not serve one of these, it is removed.

    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The Marketing Council enforces:
    - Clarity over jargon
    - Plain-English framing
    - Executive-readable language
    
    The Growth Strategy & Planning Council enforces:
    - Strategic relevance
    - No tactical drift
    - No optimism without signal
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - 1–3 paragraph executive narrative
    - Embedded context for Action Cards
    - Input to OS Drop
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    The Strategic Summary should:
    - Be readable in under 90 seconds
    - Stand alone if forwarded
    - Create alignment, not debate
    
    It should **not** attempt to convince skeptics with detail — that lives downstream.
    
    ---
    
    ## ⛔ Stop Rules
    
    Do not publish a Strategic Summary when:
    - Signal confidence is materially downgraded
    - Inputs contradict each other without resolution
    - The correct recommendation is “wait”
    
    In these cases, explicitly state uncertainty.

    ## 🧪 Example Summary (Excerpt)
    
    > “Demand in your category is heating earlier than prior years, while competitors are expanding visibility across mid-intent search terms. Your brand remains heavily dependent on branded demand, which increases paid efficiency risk as competition intensifies. This creates a narrow window to shift toward category-led acquisition before CAC rises.”
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“What story should leadership align on?”**
    
    Before asking:
    > “What should we do next?”
    ```
