    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    This module measures **how much of the category’s organic attention your brand owns relative to competitors**.
    
    Its purpose is to move conversations away from:
    > “We rank for some keywords”
    
    Toward:
    > **“How visible are we, really, compared to others who matter?”**
    
    Share of Voice (SOV) is treated as a **competitive signal**, not a vanity metric.

    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Establish competitive pressure and visibility gaps at the category level.
    
    **This module informs:**
    - Keyword Gap & Visibility prioritization
    - Growth Strategy & Planning decisions
    - Executive perception of market position
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Predict revenue
    - Replace demand sizing
    - Evaluate content quality
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    ### Primary Data Sources
    - **Ahrefs** — keyword rankings and estimated traffic share
    - **SERPAPI** (selective) — validation of top results and SERP composition
    
    ### Scope Rules
    - Focus on **core category keyword clusters**
    - Limit to **top competitors only**
    - Snapshot **monthly**, not weekly
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Logic & Calculation
    
    - Aggregate rankings across category-defining keyword clusters
    - Weight keywords by intent and estimated impact
    - Calculate relative visibility share per domain
    
    Results are **relative**, not absolute.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The SEO Visibility & Demand Council enforces:
    
    1. **Category-level visibility matters more than individual wins**  
    2. **SOV gaps indicate strategic exposure, not tactical failure**  
    3. **Rising competitors matter more than incumbents holding steady**
    
    The Strategic Intelligence Council adds context:
    - Is the category expanding or contracting?
    - Is SOV shifting meaningfully over time?
    
    ---
    
    ## 🚦 Confidence & Risk Profile
    
    - **Confidence Level:** High  
    - **Risk if Wrong:** Medium  
    
    Why:
    - Rankings data is stable
    - Competitive comparisons reduce noise
    - Click distribution can still vary by SERP features
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - SOV percentage by competitor
    - Trendline of SOV change over time
    - Executive-ready chart (radar or stacked bar)
    
    Feeds directly into:
    - Strategic Summary
    - Action Cards
    - Market Momentum interpretation
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    ### What this means
    - How competitive your visibility really is
    - Where competitive pressure is increasing
    - Whether SEO gains are keeping pace with the market
    
    ### What this does NOT mean
    - “We are losing revenue”
    - “SEO is failing”
    - “Rankings alone will fix this”
    
    ---
    
    ## ⛔ Stop Rules
    
    Do **not** overreact when:
    - SOV shifts are marginal
    - Category keywords are poorly defined
    - SERP features materially distort clicks
    
    In these cases:
    > Flag as **contextual signal only**.
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“How much of the category’s attention do we actually own?”**
    
    Before asking:
    > “What should we do about it?”
    ```
