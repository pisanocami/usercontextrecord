    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    This module converts multiple Action Cards into a **clear execution order**, balancing:
    
    - Impact
    - Effort
    - Timing
    - Confidence
    
    Its purpose is to resolve the question:
    > **“What should we do first?”**

    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Translate strategic insight into **operational sequencing**.
    
    This module does not decide *what* to do —  
    it decides *what to do first*.

    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    **Upstream Inputs**
    - Action Cards
    - Confidence Levels
    - Risk if Wrong
    - Market Momentum Index (timing context)
    
    No new external data is pulled.

    ## 🔧 Core Scoring Logic
    
    Each action is scored across four dimensions:
    
    | Dimension | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Impact** | Revenue, demand capture, or strategic leverage |
    | **Effort** | Resources, time, and coordination required |
    | **Timing Fit** | Alignment with market momentum |
    | **Confidence** | Data reliability and signal strength |
    
    Scores are **relative**, not absolute.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The Growth Strategy & Planning Council enforces:
    
    - No false precision
    - Relative ranking only
    - Explicit acknowledgement of uncertainty
    
    Scores should drive conversation — not end it.
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - Ranked list of actions
    - Simple impact vs effort visualization
    - “Do Now / Do Next / Monitor” grouping
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    Priority Scoring is:
    - A **decision aid**
    - Not a mathematical truth
    - Subject to override by leadership context
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“What’s the smartest next move?”**
    
    Not:
    > “What is guaranteed to work?”
    ```
