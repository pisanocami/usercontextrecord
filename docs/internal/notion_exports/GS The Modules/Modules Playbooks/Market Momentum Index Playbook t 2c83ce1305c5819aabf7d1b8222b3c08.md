    **Module:** Market Momentum Index  
    **Owner Council:** Strategic Intelligence  
    **Supporting Councils:** Growth Strategy & Planning

    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    This module compresses multiple external signals into a **single momentum indicator** that helps executives decide whether to **lean in, hold steady, or wait**.
    
    Its purpose is not precision —  
    it is **timing clarity**.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Answer the executive timing question:
    > **“Is now the moment to move?”**
    
    **This module informs:**
    - Budget acceleration or restraint
    - Media ramp timing
    - Strategic Summary framing
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Decide tactics
    - Set budget size
    - Replace detailed forecasting
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    **Upstream Inputs**
    - Market Demand & Seasonality
    - Breakout Terms & Trend Alerts
    - Category Visibility Benchmark
    - Emerging Competitor Watch
    
    No new APIs are called.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Logic & Index Construction
    
    Signals are scored directionally:
    - Demand acceleration vs baseline
    - Competitor visibility velocity
    - Consistency across multiple indicators
    
    The output is a **qualitative state**, not a numeric score:
    
    - Heating
    - Stable
    - Shifting
    - Cooling
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The Strategic Intelligence Council enforces:
    
    1. **Multiple signals must agree**  
    2. **Velocity matters more than size**  
    3. **Shifts matter more than peaks**
    
    The Growth Strategy & Planning Council enforces:
    - Conservative interpretation when stakes are high
    - Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty
    
    ---
    
    ## 🚦 Confidence & Risk Profile
    
    - **Confidence Level:** Medium  
    - **Risk if Wrong:** High  
    
    Why:
    - Overreaction can misallocate budget
    - External signals can lag real demand
    
    This module should **never act alone**.
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - Momentum state label
    - Supporting evidence bullets
    - Executive callout (1–2 sentences)
    
    Feeds directly into:
    - Strategic Summary
    - OS Drop
    - Priority Scoring (timing fit)
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    ### What this means
    - Whether to accelerate or pause
    - How urgent decisions are
    
    ### What this does NOT mean
    - Guaranteed growth
    - Exact timing of returns
    
    ---
    
    ## ⛔ Stop Rules
    
    Do **not** act when:
    - Signals conflict materially
    - Only one indicator shows movement
    - Category history is inconsistent
    
    In these cases:
    > Default to **“stable”**.
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“Is this a moment that rewards action?”**
    
    Not:
    > “What exactly should we do?”
    ```
