    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    This module detects **new or fast-rising competitors** based on changes in organic visibility and SERP presence.
    
    Its purpose is to prevent leadership from being surprised by:
    - New entrants
    - Quiet category shifts
    - Competitors gaining traction before they are widely recognized
    
    ---
    
    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Surface early competitive threats or opportunities.
    
    **This module informs:**
    - Strategic Intelligence briefings
    - Market Momentum Index
    - Action Cards related to differentiation or defense
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Predict competitor success
    - Judge product quality
    - Recommend immediate counter-moves

    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    ### Primary Data Sources
    - **SERPAPI**
    - **Ahrefs**
    
    ### Scope Rules
    - Track **visibility velocity**, not size
    - Focus on **new or previously insignificant domains**
    - Refresh **monthly**
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Logic & Detection Rules
    
    A competitor is flagged when:
    - Visibility growth exceeds category baseline
    - Presence expands across multiple keyword clusters
    - Momentum persists beyond a single snapshot
    
    Size matters less than **direction**.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The Strategic Intelligence Council enforces:
    
    1. **Early movement matters more than dominance**  
    2. **Consistency beats spikes**  
    3. **New narratives signal category change**
    
    ---
    
    ## 🚦 Confidence & Risk Profile
    
    - **Confidence Level:** Medium  
    - **Risk if Wrong:** Medium  
    
    Why:
    - Not all fast risers persist
    - Visibility ≠ revenue
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - List of emerging competitors
    - Visibility velocity indicators
    - Narrative notes on positioning shifts
    
    Feeds directly into:
    - Market Momentum Index
    - Strategic Summary
    - Action Cards (watch / test / defend)
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    ### What this means
    - Where the market may be changing
    - Which players warrant attention
    
    ### What this does NOT mean
    - “This competitor will win”
    - “We should copy them”
    
    ---
    
    ## ⛔ Stop Rules
    
    Do **not** escalate when:
    - Growth is isolated to one keyword
    - Visibility is driven by news or PR spikes
    - No sustained trend is present
    
    In these cases:
    > Flag as **monitor only**.
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“Who is starting to matter — before everyone notices?”**
    
    Not:
    > “Who should we fear?”
    ```
