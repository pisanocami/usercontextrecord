# Force of Nature | Growth Signal GTM System Brief

## ✨ Strategic Framing

We are **not** building a public-facing SaaS app. We are building a **GTM engine** that:

- Pulls external data using APIs or scraping (SEMrush, Ahrefs, DataForSEO)
- Structures that data into clear insight categories (SignalDB: category, intent, funnel stage)
- Uses those insights to power:
    - Personalized landing pages
    - Cold outbound emails
    - Paid ad retargeting
    - Internal growth pulse upsell motion

The app is for **internal use** only. It is a **research, signal, and insight engine** to generate:

- PDF reports
- HTML landing pages
- Agent-ready prompts
- Structured performance marketing outreach

---

## 🌟 Vision: The Intelligence Layer

We are not trying to replace Semrush or Ahrefs. We are not a data aggregator.

**We are the orchestration layer.**

- The unifier of external + internal data
- The translator between signal and action
- The interpreter that produces performance insight with creative direction

We are McKinsey + AI + media operators.

## 💡 Productized Workflow

1. **Growth Signal Reports**
    - Static landing pages generated by app for each brand (growthsignal.com/{brand})
    - Top 30% visible, bottom 70% gated
    - Gating can be email capture, account sign-up, or payment ($30–50)
2. **Outreach Campaigns**
    - Personalized cold emails with 2–3 high-signal insights
    - Highlight urgency: loss, risk, missed AI readiness
    - Link to custom page (tracked)
    - Launch across email + LinkedIn
3. **Media Retargeting**
    - Visitors tracked via Pixel
    - Retargeted with ad units tied to report insights
    - Consider YouTube Shorts or LinkedIn carousels to amplify
4. **Growth Pulse Funnel**
    - CTA in Signal page and emails = "Run a Pulse Audit"
    - Growth Pulse = $1.5K audit (manual or agent-assisted)
    - Upsell into Growth Analysis + OS Retainer

## 🎡 Design + Dev Guidance

- Landing page template should:
    - Communicate Signal → Pulse → Analysis system
    - Feel like a blend of Notion + Stripe + McKinsey deck
    - Embody Fibonacci / Force of Nature aesthetic: organic, clear, confident
- Track: scroll, CTA click, gated content engagement
- Hosted on growthsignal.com

## 🦖 Final Notes

We're not trying to build a dashboard. We're trying to build a **signal engine** that:

- Pulls insights
- Turns them into **attention**
- Converts attention into **revenue**

Start small. Move fast. Launch smart.

This is our **go-to-market system in disguise.**
