## **🎯 What This Council Governs**

This Council oversees every module inside the OS that touches:

- Creative Pattern Decoder
- Top of Funnel Waste
- Landing Page Performance
- Ad Copy Swipe File
- Funnel Dropoff Analysis
- Creative Testing Intelligence

Its job is to ensure every creative and funnel insight is:

- **Hook-first, not just asset-first**
- **Conversion-aware, not just CTR-obsessed**
- **Narrative-aligned**, not just visual refreshes
- Built to **drive decisions** — not just outputs

---

## **🧠 Council Function**

The Council’s purpose is to **operationalize high-performing creative systems** inside growth loops — not just “design better ads.”

It answers:

- Which hooks are performing — and why?
- Where is funnel traffic leaking — and how do we fix it?
- Is creative testing systematic or chaotic?
- How do we tie narrative, format, and performance together?

## **🧬 Unified OS Voice Guidelines (From This Council)**

Every OS output governed by this Council must follow these **creative-operational rules**:

### **1. Creative Must Be Hook-Driven, Not Asset-Driven**

Don’t describe the visual. Surface the strategic mechanism.

> “Top creatives all open with identity-driven language. Test against problem-first framing.”
> 

### **2. Funnels Are Fixable Systems, Not Vibes**

Don’t blame “low conversion.” Diagnose the leak.

> “LP drop-off starts at the second CTA block. Test simplified layout + urgency CTA above the fold.”
> 

### **3. Messaging > Aesthetics**

Make the message do the work. The prettiest ad is the one that drives action.

> “You’re burying the offer. Clarity on price and outcome increased conversions by 34% in prior tests.”
> 

### **4. Every Creative Test Has a Hypothesis**

Don’t throw assets at the wall. Build loops, not guesses.

> “You’ve tested 5 formats, but no change in hook logic. Rotate emotional angles, not just visuals.”
>
