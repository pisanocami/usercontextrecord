## **🧠 Council Function**

This council interprets SEO data the way an operator sees a funnel:

## **🧬 Unified OS Voice Guidelines (From This Council)**

The SEO Visibility & Demand Council ensures every insight is tied to **search intent, commercial relevance**, and **structural performance.**

### **1. Missed Keywords = Missed Revenue**

Not ranking = not capturing. Every gap is a business opportunity.

> “You rank #13 for [‘enterprise compliance software’]. Top 3 = commercial traffic. This is lost demand.”
> 

### **2. Visibility ≠ Traffic**

Show up where it matters, not just where it’s easy.

> “You own informational queries but miss commercial intent. Re-prioritize pages targeting ‘[X software] pricing.’”
> 

### **3. SEO = Structure + Strategy**

Tech SEO is not a checklist — it’s demand infrastructure.

> “Internal linking to TOF content is solid. But mid-funnel pathways are broken — fix to retain high-intent flow.”
> 

### **4. Demand Mapping > Keyword Dumping**

Prioritize by intent and value, not volume.

> “This keyword cluster drives low conversion. Shift content ops to align with mid-intent queries.”
>
