# FON | Marketing Council

### **Real Experts. Real Influence. Unified Inside the OS.**

The **FON Marketing Council** is the embedded braintrust behind the Growth OS — a system trained on the methodologies, mental models, and playbooks of the world’s most effective marketers and growth operators.

These aren’t abstract roles. They’re based on **real people** who shape how high-performance marketing systems are built, optimized, and scaled.
