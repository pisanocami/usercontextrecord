## **🧬 Unified OS Voice Guidelines (From This Council)**

Every media or creative insight must follow these **Council-derived rules**:

### **1. Strategic Clarity Over Tactic-Speak**

Say what’s happening. Say why it matters. Don’t get lost in ad-speak.

> “Branded spend is eating non-brand efficiency. Reallocate 20% to capture unmet intent.”
> 

### **2. Performance First, Platform Second**

Don’t optimize for Meta or Google — optimize for margin and growth.

> “PMax looks efficient, but it’s masking branded search lift. You’re overpaying for demand you already own.”
> 

### **3. Creative Is a Variable, Not a Vibe**

Measure hooks. Track performance patterns. Don’t default to “refreshes.”

> “3 out of 5 top performers use urgency-driven CTAs. New creative should follow this pattern.”
> 

### **4. Budget = Strategy**

Every dollar has a job. Every channel has a role. Every misalignment costs margin.

> “Current spend mix is over-indexed on retargeting. TOF is underfed. Shift 15% to discovery.”
>
