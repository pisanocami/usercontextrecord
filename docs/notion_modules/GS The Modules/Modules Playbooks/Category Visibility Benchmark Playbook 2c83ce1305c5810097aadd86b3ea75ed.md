    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    This module benchmarks **who owns organic visibility across an entire category**, not just individual keywords.
    
    Its purpose is to move leaders away from:
    > “We rank for some terms”
    
    Toward:
    > **“How much of the category’s attention do we actually control?”**
    
    This module treats search visibility as a **competitive market signal**, not an SEO performance metric.

    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Establish category-level competitive context before optimization decisions are made.
    
    **This module informs:**
    - Strategic Intelligence narratives
    - SEO investment confidence
    - Market Momentum Index inputs
    - Executive perception of competitive position
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Identify keyword-level actions
    - Estimate revenue
    - Judge content quality
    
    It sets **context**, not tactics.

    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    ### Primary Data Sources
    - **Ahrefs** — rankings and estimated traffic
    - **DataForSEO** — category-level keyword coverage (optional validation)
    
    ### Scope Rules
    - Use **category-defining keyword clusters only**
    - Limit competitors to **real category peers** (5–8 max)
    - Snapshot **monthly**
    
    > Council rule:  
    > *If the category definition is fuzzy, this module must pause and request clarification.*
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Logic & Benchmark Construction
    
    1. Aggregate rankings across category keyword clusters
    2. Normalize visibility per domain
    3. Calculate relative share of category attention
    4. Track **change over time**, not just point-in-time rank
    
    Visualization favors:
    - Radar charts
    - Stacked bars
    - Trend deltas
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The Strategic Intelligence Council enforces:
    
    1. **Relative position matters more than absolute rank**
    2. **Momentum beats incumbency**
    3. **Visibility gaps indicate strategic exposure, not failure**
    
    The SEO Visibility & Demand Council ensures:
    - Clusters reflect commercial intent
    - Noise keywords are excluded
    
    ---
    
    ## 🚦 Confidence & Risk Profile
    
    - **Confidence Level:** High  
    - **Risk if Wrong:** Medium  
    
    Why:
    - Rankings are observable
    - Category definition bias can distort interpretation
    
    ---
    
    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - Category SOV distribution
    - Competitor comparison chart
    - Visibility delta vs prior period
    
    Feeds directly into:
    - Market Momentum Index
    - Strategic Summary
    - Action Cards (contextual only)
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    ### What this means
    - How competitive your category really is
    - Where pressure is increasing
    - Whether SEO gains keep pace with peers
    
    ### What this does NOT mean
    - “We are losing revenue”
    - “SEO is broken”
    - “One keyword fix solves this”
    
    ---
    
    ## ⛔ Stop Rules
    
    Do **not** act on this module alone when:
    - Category keywords are ill-defined
    - SERP features dominate clicks
    - Visibility shifts are marginal
    
    In these cases:
    > Treat as **market context**, not an action driver.
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    This module exists to answer:
    > **“Where do we stand in the category?”**
    
    Before asking:
    > “What should we change?”
    ```
