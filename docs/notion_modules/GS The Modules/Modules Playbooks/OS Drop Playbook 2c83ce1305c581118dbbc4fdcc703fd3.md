    **Module:** OS Drop (Executive 1-Pager)  
    **Owner Council:** Growth Strategy & Planning  
    **Supporting Councils:** Marketing Council

    ## 🧠 Module Overview
    
    The OS Drop is the **executive compression layer** of the Growth Signal system.
    
    It distills the full Master Report into a **single, board-ready artifact** that answers:
    
    > **“What do we need to align on right now?”**
    
    This module does not introduce new analysis.  
    It **selects, prioritizes, and communicates** decisions already supported by underlying modules.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🎯 Strategic Role in the OS
    
    **Primary role:**  
    Create executive alignment without forcing stakeholders to read the full report.
    
    **This module informs:**
    - CMO / VP alignment
    - Board updates
    - Budget conversations
    - Cross-functional prioritization
    
    **This module does NOT:**
    - Generate insights
    - Recalculate data
    - Override council decisions
    
    It is a **presentation and synthesis layer**, not an analysis engine.

    ## 🧩 Inputs & Data Sources
    
    **Upstream Inputs**
    - Strategic Summary
    - Action Cards
    - Priority Scoring
    - Deprioritization Flags
    - Key charts from Signal & Pulse layers
    
    > No external API calls.  
    > Zero incremental data cost.
    
    ---
    
    ## 🔧 Core Logic & Assembly Rules
    
    The OS Drop must contain **exactly five sections**:
    
    1. **Market Snapshot**  
       One chart or sentence answering: *“What’s happening outside?”*
    
    2. **Position Snapshot**  
       One signal answering: *“Where do we stand?”*
    
    3. **Top 3 Actions**  
       Pulled directly from Action Cards (no rewriting logic)
    
    4. **What We’re Not Doing**  
       Pulled from Deprioritization Flags
    
    5. **Confidence Note**  
       Clear statement of inference limits or validation needs
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧠 Council Reasoning Layer
    
    The Growth Strategy & Planning Council enforces:
    
    - Brevity over completeness  
    - Decisions over explanations  
    - Alignment over optionality  
    
    If it doesn’t change a decision, it does not appear.

    ## 📤 Outputs & Artifacts
    
    - 1-page PDF / slide
    - Executive summary block
    - Visuals only (no tables)
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Interpretation Guidelines
    
    This artifact is designed to:
    - Be read in under 2 minutes
    - Be forwarded without explanation
    - Stand on its own in exec forums
    
    ---
    
    ## Final Principle
    
    The OS Drop exists to answer:
    > **“What are we aligned on?”**
    
    Not:
    > “How did we calculate this?”
    ```
