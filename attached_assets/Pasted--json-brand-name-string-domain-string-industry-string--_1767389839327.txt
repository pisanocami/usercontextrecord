```json
{
  "brand": {
    "name": "string",
    "domain": "string",
    "industry": "string",
    "business_model": "B2B | DTC | Marketplace | Hybrid",
    "primary_geography": ["string"],
    "revenue_band": "string"
  }
}
```

**Why this matters**

- Informs confidence thresholds
- Shapes seasonality interpretation
- Prevents one-size-fits-all logic

---

### **B. Category Definition (Semantic Fence)**

Defines **what category we are operating in**.

```json
{
  "category_definition": {
    "primary_category": "string",
    "included": [
      "included product or service types"
    ],
    "excluded": [
      "explicitly out-of-scope categories"
    ]
  }
}
```

This creates a **semantic fence**, not just keyword filtering.

---

### **C. Competitive Set (Explicit & Reviewable)**

Defines **who we compare against**.

```json
{
  "competitors": {
    "direct": ["domain"],
    "indirect": ["domain"],
    "marketplaces": ["domain"]
  }
}
```

**Rules**

- Direct vs indirect must be distinguished
- Marketplace competition must be explicit
- Model may suggest competitors
- Humans must approve or override

---

### **D. Demand Definition (Critical)**

Defines **what demand we care about**.

```json
{
  "demand_definition": {
    "brand_keywords": {
      "seed_terms": ["string"],
      "top_n": 20
    },
    "non_brand_keywords": {
      "category_terms": ["string"],
      "problem_terms": ["string"],
      "top_n": 50
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this matters**

- Anchors brand vs non-brand logic
- Prevents keyword noise
- Governs SEO, demand, and cannibalization modules

---

### **E. Strategic Intent & Guardrails**

Defines **how aggressive or conservative the system should be**.

```json
{
  "strategic_intent": {
    "growth_priority": "string",
    "risk_tolerance": "low | medium | high",
    "primary_goal": "string",
    "secondary_goals": ["string"],
    "avoid": ["string"]
  }
}
```

This is **operator intent**, not data.

---

### **F. Channel Context (Qualitative Only)**

Provides **high-level reality** without internal access.

```json
{
  "channel_context": {
    "paid_media_active": true,
    "seo_investment_level": "low | medium | high",
    "marketplace_dependence": "low | medium | high"
  }
}
```

**Rule**

> Channel Context is qualitative only — never quantitative.
> 

---

### **G. Negative Scope & Exclusions (Required)**

Defines **explicit “NOT THIS” boundaries**.

```json
{
  "negative_scope": {
    "excluded_categories": [
      "adjacent but non-core categories",
      "unrelated product classes",
      "services or products not sold by the brand"
    ],
    "excluded_keywords": [
      "keywords tied to excluded categories",
      "keywords signaling different buyer intent",
      "out-of-scope vertical terms"
    ],
    "excluded_use_cases": [
      "use cases outside the brand’s value proposition",
      "audiences the brand does not serve"
    ],
    "excluded_competitors": [
      "brands competing in adjacent but irrelevant markets",
      "marketplaces not strategically relevant"
    ],
    "enforcement_rules": {
      "hard_exclusion": true,
      "allow_model_suggestion": false,
      "require_human_override_for_expansion": true
    }
  }
}
```

If something is excluded here, **it must never appear anywhere downstream**.

---

### **H. Governance, Confidence & Overrides (Non-Negotiable)**

Defines **human control and auditability**.

```json
{
  "governance": {
    "model_suggested": true,
    "human_overrides": {
      "competitors": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "categories": []
    },
    "context_confidence": {
      "level": "high | medium | low",
      "notes": "string"
    },
    "last_reviewed": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "reviewed_by": "string",
    "context_valid_until": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "cmo_safe": true
  }
}
```

**Key principle**

> The model may suggest.
> 

> Humans decide.
> 

> The system remembers.
>

## **🔒 Enforcement Rules (System-Wide)**

### **1️⃣ Hard Pre-Filter (Before Any Analysis)**

Before:

- Keyword expansion
- Competitor suggestion
- SERP scraping
- Trend analysis

Apply:

```python
if item in negative_scope:
    reject
```

If excluded here, it **never enters the system**.

---

### **2️⃣ Module Inheritance (No Silent Expansion)**

All modules receive:

- Positive scope (what’s included)
- Negative scope (what’s excluded)

Modules are **not allowed** to:

- Add categories
- Expand verticals
- Override exclusions

Any proposed expansion must:

- Be flagged
- Require human approval

---

### **3️⃣ Council-Level Enforcement**

Councils treat context as **non-negotiable guardrails**.

If output includes excluded scope → **fail the run**.
