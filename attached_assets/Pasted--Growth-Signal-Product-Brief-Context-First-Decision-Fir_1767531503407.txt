# 🌪️ Growth Signal — Product Brief (Context-First, Decision-First Design)

**Audience:** Product, Engineering, Design

**Status:** v1 (Foundational)

**Purpose:** Define the **core product abstraction** behind Growth Signal — the **User Context Record** — and how it governs **all downstream analysis, judgment, restraint, and decision-making**.

This document is intended to be:

- Cut-and-pasted into Notion
- Used directly by developers
- Treated as a **system contract**, not marketing copy

---

## 🧠 Executive Summary

At the core of Growth Signal is a **User Context Record**.

This record represents the **explicit, reviewable assumptions** about a brand’s reality:

- Who the brand is
- Who they compete with
- What demand they are trying to capture
- What is *in scope* — and explicitly *out of scope*

Every Growth Signal module **must inherit this record before performing any analysis**.

No module is allowed to:

- Infer context silently
- Expand scope implicitly
- Invent competitors or demand definitions
- Override exclusions without human approval

> Growth Signal does not analyze “the internet.”
It analyzes a specific brand’s situation — as defined by an explicit, shared context record.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Most growth tools fail because they:

- Infer competitors implicitly
- Expand keyword scope silently
- Treat “demand” as generic volume
- Hide assumptions inside models
- Produce outputs that feel *technically reasonable but business-insane*

This leads to:

- Generic insights
- Low executive trust
- Overconfident recommendations
- Endless internal debate
- Embarrassing outputs (e.g. dog collars → cat litter boxes)

Growth Signal is intentionally different.

We start with a **structured brief**, the same way a senior operator would — and we never run analysis without it.

## 🧱 Core Concept: The User Context Record

The **User Context Record** is the **single source of truth** for Growth Signal.

It defines:

- The brand being analyzed
- The competitive landscape
- The demand universe
- Strategic intent and risk posture
- Explicit exclusions (“not this”)
- Governance, confidence, and override rules

All modules consume this record.

All councils reason *over* this record.

No module may invent or alter context on its own.

Think of it as:

> The brief you’d give your smartest operator before asking, “What should we do?”

## 🧩 User Context Record — Canonical Schema (v1)

### A. Brand Identity & Scope

Defines **who** the analysis is for.

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "name": "string",
    "domain": "string",
    "industry": "string",
    "business_model": "B2B | DTC | Marketplace | Hybrid",
    "primary_geography": ["string"],
    "revenue_band": "string"
  }
}
```

**Why this matters**

- Informs confidence thresholds
- Shapes seasonality interpretation
- Prevents one-size-fits-all logic

---

### **B. Category Definition (Semantic Fence)**

Defines **what category we are operating in**.

```json
{
  "category_definition": {
    "primary_category": "string",
    "included": [
      "included product or service types"
    ],
    "excluded": [
      "explicitly out-of-scope categories"
    ]
  }
}
```

This creates a **semantic fence**, not just keyword filtering.

---

### **C. Competitive Set (Explicit & Reviewable)**

Defines **who we compare against**.

```json
{
  "competitors": {
    "direct": ["domain"],
    "indirect": ["domain"],
    "marketplaces": ["domain"]
  }
}
```

**Rules**

- Direct vs indirect must be distinguished
- Marketplace competition must be explicit
- Model may suggest competitors
- Humans must approve or override

---

### **D. Demand Definition (Critical)**

Defines **what demand we care about**.

```json
{
  "demand_definition": {
    "brand_keywords": {
      "seed_terms": ["string"],
      "top_n": 20
    },
    "non_brand_keywords": {
      "category_terms": ["string"],
      "problem_terms": ["string"],
      "top_n": 50
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this matters**

- Anchors brand vs non-brand logic
- Prevents keyword noise
- Governs SEO, demand, and cannibalization modules

---

### **E. Strategic Intent & Guardrails**

Defines **how aggressive or conservative the system should be**.

```json
{
  "strategic_intent": {
    "growth_priority": "string",
    "risk_tolerance": "low | medium | high",
    "primary_goal": "string",
    "secondary_goals": ["string"],
    "avoid": ["string"]
  }
}
```

This is **operator intent**, not data.

---

### **F. Channel Context (Qualitative Only)**

Provides **high-level reality** without internal access.

```json
{
  "channel_context": {
    "paid_media_active": true,
    "seo_investment_level": "low | medium | high",
    "marketplace_dependence": "low | medium | high"
  }
}
```

**Rule**

> Channel Context is qualitative only — never quantitative.
> 

---

### **G. Negative Scope & Exclusions (Required)**

Defines **explicit “NOT THIS” boundaries**.

```json
{
  "negative_scope": {
    "excluded_categories": [
      "adjacent but non-core categories",
      "unrelated product classes",
      "services or products not sold by the brand"
    ],
    "excluded_keywords": [
      "keywords tied to excluded categories",
      "keywords signaling different buyer intent",
      "out-of-scope vertical terms"
    ],
    "excluded_use_cases": [
      "use cases outside the brand’s value proposition",
      "audiences the brand does not serve"
    ],
    "excluded_competitors": [
      "brands competing in adjacent but irrelevant markets",
      "marketplaces not strategically relevant"
    ],
    "enforcement_rules": {
      "hard_exclusion": true,
      "allow_model_suggestion": false,
      "require_human_override_for_expansion": true
    }
  }
}
```

If something is excluded here, **it must never appear anywhere downstream**.

---

### **H. Governance, Confidence & Overrides (Non-Negotiable)**

Defines **human control and auditability**.

```json
{
  "governance": {
    "model_suggested": true,
    "human_overrides": {
      "competitors": [],
      "keywords": [],
      "categories": []
    },
    "context_confidence": {
      "level": "high | medium | low",
      "notes": "string"
    },
    "last_reviewed": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "reviewed_by": "string",
    "context_valid_until": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "cmo_safe": true
  }
}
```

**Key principle**

> The model may suggest.
> 

> Humans decide.
> 

> The system remembers.
> 

---

## **🔒 Enforcement Rules (System-Wide)**

### **1️⃣ Hard Pre-Filter (Before Any Analysis)**

Before:

- Keyword expansion
- Competitor suggestion
- SERP scraping
- Trend analysis

Apply:

```python
if item in negative_scope:
    reject
```

If excluded here, it **never enters the system**.

---

### **2️⃣ Module Inheritance (No Silent Expansion)**

All modules receive:

- Positive scope (what’s included)
- Negative scope (what’s excluded)

Modules are **not allowed** to:

- Add categories
- Expand verticals
- Override exclusions

Any proposed expansion must:

- Be flagged
- Require human approval

---

### **3️⃣ Council-Level Enforcement**

Councils treat context as **non-negotiable guardrails**.

If output includes excluded scope → **fail the run**.

---

### **4️⃣ Human Override (When Needed)**

Expansion is allowed **only** with explicit override and reason.

Overrides are:

- Logged
- Versioned
- Auditable

## **🔄 How the Context Record Is Used**

1. **Model Suggests Initial Context**
    - Competitors
    - Keywords
    - Demand themes
2. **Human Reviews & Confirms**
    - Accepts / removes / adjusts
    - Context marked as human-confirmed
3. **Modules Inherit Context**
    - No silent expansion
    - No redefinition of reality
4. **Councils Reason Over Context**
    - Decisions are made with known assumptions
    - Restraint and confidence enforced consistently

---

## **🧠 What This Unlocks**

With a User Context Record in place:

- Outputs are consistent across modules
- Confidence and restraint are coherent
- Debugging becomes “review assumptions”
- Executive trust increases
- Embarrassing outputs are prevented
- Overrides don’t break the system

> Disagreements become about assumptions, not algorithms.
> 

---

## **🧭 Product Principles to Enforce**

- No analysis without context
- No hidden assumptions
- No silent scope expansion
- Human override is always possible
- Context is versioned and expires
- “Embarrassment-safe” is a requirement

---

## **🚫 What This Is Not**

This is not:

- A CRM record
- A persona document
- A static setup form
- A place for performance metrics

This is **core product infrastructure**.

---

## **🧠 Final Product Principle**

> Every Growth Signal insight is only as good as the assumptions it inherits.
> 

> Make those assumptions explicit, reviewable, overrideable, and enforceable.
> 

This record is the foundation everything else stands on.
