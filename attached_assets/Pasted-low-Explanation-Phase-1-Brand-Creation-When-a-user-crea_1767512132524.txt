low Explanation
Phase 1: Brand Creation
When a user creates a brand, Django automatically triggers a signal that creates a UserContextRecord with all 8 sections pre-populated with defaults.
Phase 2: Context Sections
The 8 sections define everything the AI needs to know:
Brand Identity: Who you are
Category Definition: Your market space
Competitive Set: Your competitors
Demand Definition: What people search for
Negative Scope: What to NEVER include :warning:
Strategic Intent: Your goals
Channel Context: Your investments
Governance: Review status
Phase 3: Validation Gate
Before any analysis runs, the system validates:
Are all required fields filled?
Is Negative Scope populated?
Has a human reviewed it?
If incomplete → Human Review UI. If complete → Lock context.
Phase 4: Pre-Filter Layer
This is the first safety gate. Before calling any external API:
Load the locked context
Check every keyword/competitor/category against Negative Scope
Block excluded items BEFORE they reach APIs
Log everything that was filtered
Phase 5: External APIs
Only clean, validated data reaches external services:
Ahrefs for keyword data
Bright Data for SERP scraping
Google Trends for trend analysis
Prophet for forecasting
Phase 6: AI Councils
Five specialized AI councils analyze the filtered data:
Growth Strategy Council
SEO Visibility Council
Performance Media Council
Strategic Intelligence Council
Product GTM Council
Phase 7: Post-Validation
This is the second safety gate. After AI generates output:
Scan output for any excluded terms
If found → Reject and regenerate
If clean → Proceed to Decision Engine
Phase 8: Decision Engine
Classifies each opportunity:
PREPARE: New opportunity, build foundation
RAMP: Initial traction, scale up
EXPLOIT: Proven success, maximize
HOLD: Stable, maintain
AVOID: Negative ROI or excluded
Phase 9: Output Generation
Creates deliverables:
AI-powered insights
Actionable recommendations
Confidence scores
Filter log (what was blocked and why)
Phase 10: Frontend Display
Dashboard shows everything with full transparency. Users can:
See insights and recommendations
View what was filtered
Take action
Update context (feedback loop)
Key Takeaways
Context is required — No module runs without locked context
Double filtering — Pre-filter before APIs, post-validate after AI
Full transparency — Users see what was filtered and why
Feedback loop — Context can be updated based on results

Hi Susan! I am here, and I see that there are many definitions, which one should I use? The last one , Or should I wait for some confirmation?
